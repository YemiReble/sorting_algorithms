# Sorting algorithms & Big O

- [x] C
- [x] Algorithm
- [x] Data structure

## Insight
Project to be done in teams of 2 people (By Sulaimon Abodunrin and Najib Tackie)

### Learning Objectives
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## O Notation
* O(1)
* O(n)
* O(n!)
* n square -> O(n^2)
* log(n) -> O(log(n))
* n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
* n + k -> O(n+k)
